# hpke

An implementation of hpke loosely based on draft-barnes-cfrg-hpke-01

hpke.wrap and hpke.unwrap working. See test_hpke.py for usage examples...

To do:
 - simple commandline interface for file encryption
 - test vectors including secret keys
 - review and possibly update to: https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-hpke-06.txt
