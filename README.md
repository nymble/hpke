# hpke

An implementation of Hybrid Public Key Encryption (hpke).

hpke.wrap and hpke.unwrap working. See test_hpke.py for usage examples...

To do:
 - simple commandline interface for file encryption
 - test vectors including secret keys
 - review and possibly update to: https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-hpke-06.txt


Note - original version, notation and variable were made to loosely match the specification draft-barnes-cfrg-hpke-01.
