# hpke

An implementation loosely based on draft-barnes-cfrg-hpke-01

hpke.wrap and hpke.unwrap working, but need to complete:
 - simple commandline interface for file encryption
 - test vectors including secret keys
 
 
 See test_hpke.py for usage examples...

Should update to: https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-hpke-02.txt
